# 🧠 Recode Python Backend Development Guide

Welcome to Recode! To maintain a high standard of code quality, we follow a strict development and
pull request process.  
Before submitting your PR, please **follow the instructions below and attach a screenshot of the
checks passed**.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

- Python **3.8 or higher**
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- Git

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Configuration

### 🔧 Core Linting and QA Tools

We use the following tools to enforce code quality:

- `flake8`: Enforces PEP8 compliance
- `black`: Code formatting with 88-char line width
- `isort`: Automatically sorts imports
- `mypy`: Static type checking with strict rules
- `bandit`: Security vulnerability scanning
- `safety`: Checks for insecure packages
- `pre-commit`: Git hook to ensure checks are run before commit

### ⚙️ Config Files

| File                         | Purpose                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.flake8`                    | Linting rules with complexity settings                         |
| `pyproject.toml`             | Central config for `black`, `isort`, `mypy`, and `coverage`    |
| `.pre-commit-config.yaml`    | Pre-commit setup for linting, typing, formatting, and security |
| `requirements-dev.txt`       | Dev dependencies with fixed versions                           |
| `.github/workflows/lint.yml` | CI/CD workflow for automated PR checks                         |
| `Makefile`                   | Common commands for easy use                                   |

## 🧪 Development Setup

### 🔄 Install Dev Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install


📋 Makefile Commands
Use these commands for a smooth workflow:

make install     # Set up the development environment
make format      # Auto-format code (black + isort)
make lint        # Run flake8, mypy, bandit, etc.
make test        # Run tests with coverage report
make all         # Run everything above in sequence

🚀 GitHub Actions Integration
Our CI/CD pipeline automatically runs on every pull request and includes:

Python versions: 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11

Code formatting validation (black)

Linting and static typing checks (flake8, mypy)

Security scanning (bandit, safety)

Test execution and coverage report

📸 Pull Request Submission Checklist
