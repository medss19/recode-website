## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Github is a way of version control your software development using Git, Github was founded in 2008
and recently Microsoft has bought the company now Microsoft is the parent organization of Github. So
what do I mean by version control? When developing software the important hurdle is merging the
version as part of development or update. Github helps developers in this perspective, this allows
collaboration between the developers to work simultaneously.

Let’s create a Github Account

### Step 1: Let’s create a Github Account

1. Go to the [GitHub Website](https://github.com/).

   <BrowserWindow url="https://github.com/" bodyStyle={{padding: 0}}>  
    [![Visual Studio Code](./assets/image-2.png)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) </BrowserWindow>

### Step 2: Finishing the account creation

1. Get your username:

   Firstly, you have to enter the username, few usernames won’t be available, so try the
   combinations with hyphens to create a unique one, Enter the email address which may need to
   verify later. Then password and Bot verification as shown below. Once this is done Create account
   button below will be active. Click on that to proceed further.
   - **Live Server:** Launch a local development server with live reload feature. <BrowserWindow
     url="https://github.com/" bodyStyle={{padding: 0}}>  
      [![Visual Studio Code](./assets/image-2.png)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) </BrowserWindow>

   - **Prettier:** In the next, you can see few questions from GitHub to know about you. Once you
     are done filling those click on complete setup

   <BrowserWindow url="https://github.com/" bodyStyle={{padding: 0}}>  
    [![Visual Studio Code](./assets/image-2.png)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) </BrowserWindow>
   - 1. What kind of work do you do mainly?

### Step 3:

Next step, Github will ask you to verify the account. As a final step it will ask you to verify the
account, all you need to go to the email dashboard and verify the mail ID to proceed further. After
verification, you will be redirected to the Github page as shown below, can also see whether your
account is verified or not as highlighted below. I would recommend skipping this step to proceed
further.
