## Why Do You Need an IDE?

This IDE helps you to execute and maintain the workflow of SQL, It acts as a source code editor, and
a debugger. It basically help you to execute and debug any bugs for developer. Especially when comes
to DBA (Database adminstration), managing huge dataset can be tiring here, it will help you with
performance dashboard and quick improvement features.

### Key Features to Look for in an IDE/Text Editor

1. **Syntax :** Highlights the color, make code readbility.
2. **Accelerate Work stucture:** Help you to sort and visualise the messy database.
3. **Helps managing Database:** Allows you to store the data, create workflow and organise it.

## Conclusion

I hope you understood the concept here, if not yet, think like its a nice view from your house, it
lets you see whats happening outside in your comfort zone, if anything happening to the house, the
view remain same, Workbench works the simillar way, it helps you to see the data in the databse,
just like your house SQL workbench doesnt have the data, if you remove workbench nothing happens to
your databse.
