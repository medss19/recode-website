# üìó Table Creation

Welcome to the **Selecting Data** module! This foundational learning path is designed to help you
master the basics of querying data, particularly focusing on how to retrieve specific information
from databases effectively.

### üìò Creating SQL Table

In SQL, when creating a table, each column must have a data type that defines what kind of data it
can hold. Common data types include:

> `INTEGER` ‚Äì whole numbers `REAL` ‚Äì decimal (floating-point) numbers `TEXT` ‚Äì strings of characters

> Other types like `BLOB` and `NULL` exist but are not covered in this tutorial.

## üõ†Ô∏è Example: Creating a Table

### Lesson Overview

Let‚Äôs create a simple table named Directory, which holds the floor number and company name.

> This CREATE TABLE statement defines a new table called Directory with two columns:

> `floor` ‚Äî stores the floor number as an `INTEGER`

> `company` ‚Äî stores the company name as `TEXT`

    :::info

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="SQL Code" label="SQL Code">
  
  ```sql title="Creating SQL Tables & db. "

CREATE TABLE Directory ( floor INTEGER, company TEXT ); ``` </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="how-git-works" label="Output">

Query OK, table created successfully. </TabItem> </Tabs>

:::

:::tip ‚úÖ Tip: SQL keywords like CREATE TABLE, INTEGER, and TEXT are not case-sensitive, but using
uppercase for SQL keywords improves readability.

:::

### üßæ Inserting Data into a Table

    :::info
    Once a table structure is created using CREATE TABLE, the next step is to insert data into it. You can insert as many rows as you want, at any time.

    We‚Äôll continue with the Directory table from earlier. Let‚Äôs insert a couple of company records.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="SQL Code" label="SQL Code">
  
  ```sql title="Creating SQL Tables. "
CREATE TABLE Directory (
  floor INTEGER,
  company TEXT
);

INSERT INTO Directory (floor, company) VALUES (1, 'Acme Inc.');

INSERT INTO Directory (floor, company) VALUES (2, 'Homeflix');

    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="how-git-works" label="Output">

| floor | company   |
| ----- | --------- |
| 1     | Acme Inc. |
| 2     | Homeflix  |

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::

:::tip ‚úÖ Tip: Always match the order of columns in your INSERT INTO statement with the order of
values inside VALUES().

üö´ Avoiding Duplicate Table Creation When running a CREATE TABLE command, trying to create a table
that already exists will usually result in an error. To avoid this, we can use the IF NOT EXISTS
clause.

```sql title="Creating SQL Tables.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Directory (
floor INTEGER,
company TEXT
);
```

# ‚úÖ What You Have Learned

In this module, you learned the fundamentals of creating tables in SQL, including:

- **Defining Table Structure**  
  How to use the `CREATE TABLE` statement to define a new table and specify columns with appropriate
  data types.

- **Common Data Types**  
  The purpose of data types like `INTEGER` for numbers and `TEXT` for strings.

- **Inserting Data**  
  How to add rows to a table using the `INSERT INTO` statement.

- **Preventing Duplicate Tables**  
  Using `IF NOT EXISTS` with `CREATE TABLE` to avoid errors if the table already exists.

- **Best Practices**  
  Writing SQL keywords in uppercase for readability and matching column order in `INSERT INTO`
  statements.

## üìù Quiz: Test Your Knowledge

#### 1. How can you ensure a table is only created if it doesn't already exist, to avoid errors?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>By adding <code>IF NOT EXISTS</code> to the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement:</li>
  </ul>

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Directory (
  floor INTEGER,
  company TEXT
);
```

</details>
#### 2. Complete the column definition for the `Tickets` table creation syntax with the appropriate column data types.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Tickets (
    qty _____,
    email _____
  );
  ```
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Specify <code>qty</code> as <code>INTEGER</code> and <code>email</code> as <code>TEXT</code>:</li>
  </ul>

```sql
CREATE TABLE Tickets (
  qty INTEGER,
  email TEXT
);
```

</details>

#### 3. Which of the following code can delete all the values from the given table?

- `DELETE FROM toys WHERE price < 10`
- `DELETE FROM toys`
  <details>
    <summary>Answer</summary>
    <ul>
      <li><code>DELETE FROM toys</code> will delete all rows from the <code>toys</code> table.</li>
    </ul>

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM toys;
  ```

  </details>

---

#### 4. What happens if you call `UPDATE` with a `WHERE` clause that does not match any existing row?

- SQLite will update the next closest row
- Nothing will change
- SQLite will automatically create a new row with the provided data

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Nothing will change</strong> ‚Äî If no rows match the <code>WHERE</code> clause, no rows are updated.</li>
  </ul>
</details>
#### 5. Write an SQL statement to update the streams count for the song "Paradise" by "The Jets" to 130.
| songname           | artist        | streams | certifications |
|--------------------|---------------|---------|----------------|
| Paradise           | The Jets      | 120     |                |
| My Way             | Stevie J      | 100     |                |
| Purple Sunrise     | Harry         | 90      |                |
| California Highway | Joan & Jerry  | 85      |                |
| My Sister Meg      | Couches       | 70      |                |
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the <code>UPDATE</code> statement with a <code>WHERE</code> clause to target the correct row:</li>
  </ul>

```sql
UPDATE Songs
SET streams = 130
WHERE songname = 'Paradise';
```

</details>

#### 6. Which of the following is not a requirement for defining a SQL table‚Äôs columns?

- Column name
- Column constraints
- Column data type

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Column constraints</strong> ‚Äî This is not a requirement for defining a column in a SQL table.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

#### 7. Which of the following is not a valid SQL column data type?

- REAL
- BOOLEAN
- TEXT

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>BOOLEAN</strong> ‚Äî Standard SQL does not define <code>BOOLEAN</code> as a column data type. Some databases support it as an alias, but it is not part of the SQL standard.</li>
  </ul>
